= Q: I've inserted a shortcode to insert a particular song in a page; but it is loading with the same layout that the songs in the store. Can be loaded the song or collection with all fields, with the layout used in the particular page of the product? =

A: The shortcode to insert a product has the structure: [music_store_product id="10"]. The "id" attribute represents the product's id. The products' ids are displayed as the first column in the songs or collection lists.

The product's shortcode accepts another attribute, to decide the layout to use: the "single" layout, with all the product's fields, or the "store" layout, with the fields that are displayed in the store's page.

        [music_store_product id="10" layout="single"]       
        [music_store_product id="10" layout="store"]        

= Q: Is there any restriction on the size of the audio files to upload to the server? =

A: The limit in the files sizes to be upload to the server is not imposed by the plugin. The Music Store delegates the upload process to the Media Library of WordPress. The limits are imposed by directives in the PHP.ini file, directly by your hosting provider.

If you need additional information about the PHP directives involved in this process, visit the following link:
http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size

= Q: Are there any restriction in the download the purchased files in a zipped file? =

A: The zipped files are created in memory, so the PHP script in your web server, should manage the amount of memory sufficient to create the zipped file with all purchased audio files. To take an idea about the amount of memory required, uses as reference the peak in the sum of size of audio files in the bigger purchase, before enabling the zip option. 

= Q: A customer that has purchased a product from the store, has not downloaded the song in the time interval defined in the store's settings. What can I do in this case? =

A: In this case you only should go to the sales reports of the store, through the menu option: "Music Store/Sales Report", and select the time period where the purchase was made. In the product list will be displayed all sales in the time interval selected. Finally, you should press the "Reset Time and Downloads" button corresponding to the customer's purchase. 

Now, your user can download the product by a new time period.

= Q: How to know the products purchased for a customer? =

A: Go to the sales reports, and type the customer's email in the input box named "buyer", and select a time interval where could be occurred the sales, and finally press the "Search" button. 

If you are not sure about the customer email, you can use a partial email address ( is not necessary to know the exact email address). About the time interval, if you are not sure about the date where the sales occurred, select as the "From" data a sufficient far away date.

= Q: How can be customized the download page? =

A: The download page is a special page, that is populated at runtime. By default the page is empty, but the download links are added at the end of page when it is visited by the users. This page, can be edited like any other page in WordPress. You simply should open the page for edition, and modify its content. 

I suggest you that the last information in your download page, be a text indicating that the links below are the download links to the purchased files.

= Q: Why the customers are not receiving the download links after purchase the songs? =

A: Please, be sure you have enabled the IPN (Instant Payment Notification) in your PayPal account. If the IPN is not enabled in your PayPal account, the website is not notified after the payments, and the download link is not generated, and the notification email with the download link is not sent to the customers.

PayPal will ask you for the URL of the IPN in the activation process, use the URL to your website's homepage to activate the IPN, because the "Music Store" will send to PayPal the correct IPN's URL.

= Q: The IPN is enabled in my PayPal account, but the customers are not receiving the emails with the download links. =

A: If the IPN is enabled in your PayPal account, and the purchases have been registered in the sales report, but your customers are not receiving the emails with the download links, there are two probable reasons:

1. The email should be sent through SMTP. In this case you should install in your WordPress one of the available plugins for SMTP integration, in the WordPress directory.

2. The web server allows send emails directly, but the email address entered in the "Notification from email" attribute, is an email address that not belongs to the same domain of the website. In this case, the main email services classify the emails as a possible identity fishing, and delete the email by security. You should enter in this attribute an email address belonging to the same website's domain.

= Q: How the customers can return automatically to the download page after purchase a song? = 

A: This option is related directly with the PayPal settings, and not with the Music Store. Please, follows the indications below:

Note: The description applies for the new interface of PayPal.

From the homepage of your PayPal account, press the "Seller preferences" option. In the seller's profile there is an option titled "Website preferences", with the text "Bring customers back to my website after they pay with PayPal.", please, press the "change" link associated with this option, and set the auto return to "ON". PayPal requires you enter the URL to the return page, use in this case the URL to your website's homepage, because the Music Store sends the correct URL in the sale process.

PayPal notifies the payments to the website asynchronously, so can occur that the user returns to the download page, before the payment notification, so, the sale has not been registered yet. In this case the download page displays a timer, and checks again the validity of purchase.

= Q: The download page is displaying a 404 Error, page not found =

A: By default the Music Store generates the page called "Download Page", with its content empty. The content of the "Download Page" is generated dynamically with the download links to purchased products, but sometimes, the websites administrators decide delete this page because think that is not important. If it is the case you only should restore the download page, from the trash list, to the list of published pages. If you have emptied the trash list, you only should create a new page with the slug: ms-download-page

= Q: The shopping cart page is displaying a 404 Error, page not found =

A: By default the Music Store generates the page called "Shopping Cart", with its content empty. The content of the "Shopping Cart" page is generated dynamically, and includes a table with the products selected, a button to continue shopping, a button to complete the payment, and the input box for entering the coupon code, but as its content is empty by default ( its content is generated in execution time ), the websites administrators sometimes decide delete this page because think that is not important. If it is the case you only should restore the shopping cart page, from the trash list, to the list of published pages. if you have emptied the trash list, you only should create a new page with the slug: ms-shopping-cart

= Q: Can be sold tangible products with the music store? =

A: For selling tangible products, like CDs, DVDs, etc. is required an additional module for asking to the customers its postal address, furthermore will be required add to the products prices the shipping cost, and finally accept the selection of number of copies. With the Music Store, none of these modules are included, because are not needed for selling digital files, this is the reason our plugin is recommended only for selling digital files.

= Q: Can be created multiple products at time, or should be created one by one? =

A: The pro version of the Music Store includes a new section (the importer section) that allows create multiple products at the same time. The better results  are obtained if  the audio files have defined the ID3 tags with the correct information.

To proceed importing multiple songs, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the menu option: "Music Store/Songs Importer"

2. Press the "Upload/Select files" button to display the "Media Library". From the media library it is possible select the files existent in the library, or activate the "Upload Files" tab, and upload new files to the library.

3. Enter a base price that will be applied to all imported songs.

4. Check any of the attributes: artist, albums names, genres, or year, if you want extract the artist name, the album name, the genre, or the year, from the ID3 tags of the MP3 files, and assign these data to the imported products.

5. Finally, press the "Import" button.

The importer will create a new product for each audio file, with the information included in the ID3 tags.
